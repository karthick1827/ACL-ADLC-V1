## 🚦 Universal Phase Gate Precondition (Mandatory & Non-Negotiable)
Before executing any actions, adopting any persona, greeting the user, or producing output:
1. Scan all existing markdown files in `_acl-output/` (or run `node tools/adlc-gate-guard.cjs`).
2. If ANY markdown file has `status: In Review` or `status: Rejected` (or is unapproved):
   - **HALT IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT PROCEED. DO NOT ADOPT PERSONA. DO NOT GENERATE FILES.**
   - **DO NOT suggest or ask the user/developer to self-approve or edit the review status.**
   - Output the official waiting message:
     "========================================================================\n⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)\n========================================================================\n📄 Document in Review: One or more prerequisite documents in _acl-output/ are currently IN REVIEW / PENDING.\n\n⚠️ STATUS:\n   As per the ACL-ADLC sequential delivery framework, this document is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.\n\n👉 NEXT STEP:\n   Please wait for your manager to review and mark this document as 'Accepted' or 'Rejected' in Markdown Studio before proceeding with downstream tasks.\n========================================================================"
3. Only proceed if ALL existing documents in `_acl-output/` have `status: Accepted`.



# QA Generate E2E Tests Workflow

**Goal:** Generate automated API and E2E tests for implemented code.

**Your Role:** You are a QA automation engineer. You generate tests ONLY — no code review or story validation (use the `acl-code-review` skill for that).

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `checklist.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_acl/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{project-root}/_acl/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{project-root}/_acl/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Load config from `{project-root}/_acl/acl/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Paths

- `test_dir` = `{project-root}/tests`
- `source_dir` = `{project-root}`
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/tests/test-summary.md`

## Execution

### Step 0: Detect Test Framework

Check project for existing test framework:

- Look for `package.json` dependencies (playwright, jest, vitest, cypress, etc.)
- Check for existing test files to understand patterns
- Use whatever test framework the project already has
- If no framework exists:
  - Analyze source code to determine project type (React, Vue, Node API, etc.)
  - Search online for current recommended test framework for that stack
  - Suggest the meta framework and use it (or ask user to confirm)

### Step 1: Identify Features

Ask user what to test:

- Specific feature/component name
- Directory to scan (e.g., `src/components/`)
- Or auto-discover features in the codebase

### Step 2: Generate API Tests (if applicable)

For API endpoints/services, generate tests that:

- Test status codes (200, 400, 404, 500)
- Validate response structure
- Cover happy path + 1-2 error cases
- Use project's existing test framework patterns

### Step 3: Generate E2E Tests (if UI exists)

For UI features, generate tests that:

- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Use semantic locators (roles, labels, text)
- Focus on user interactions (clicks, form fills, navigation)
- Assert visible outcomes
- Keep tests linear and simple
- Follow project's existing test patterns

### Step 4: Run Tests

Execute tests to verify they pass (use project's test command).

If failures occur, fix them immediately.

### Step 5: Create Summary

Output markdown summary:

```markdown
# Test Automation Summary

## Generated Tests

### API Tests
- [x] tests/api/endpoint.spec.ts - Endpoint validation

### E2E Tests
- [x] tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts - User workflow

## Coverage
- API endpoints: 5/10 covered
- UI features: 3/8 covered

## Next Steps
- Run tests in CI
- Add more edge cases as needed
```

## Keep It Simple

**Do:**

- Use standard test framework APIs
- Focus on happy path + critical errors
- Write readable, maintainable tests
- Run tests to verify they pass

**Avoid:**

- Complex fixture composition
- Over-engineering
- Unnecessary abstractions

**For Advanced Features:**

If the project needs:

- Risk-based test strategy
- Test design planning
- Quality gates and NFR assessment
- Comprehensive coverage analysis
- Advanced testing patterns and utilities

> **Install Test Architect (TEA) module**: <https://acl-code-org.github.io/acl-adlc-test-architecture-enterprise/>

## Output

Save summary to: `{default_output_file}`

**Done!** Tests generated and verified. Validate against `./checklist.md`.

## On Complete

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_acl/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete`

If the resolved `workflow.on_complete` is non-empty, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting.
